1. Microcontroller Selection
----------------------------

- Open ``STM32CubeMX``.

- Click ``New Project``.

- Select ``MCU/MPU Selector`` if you want to select microcontroller IC number or select ``Board Selector`` if you want to select using development board number. For example, **STM32F407G-DISC1** from ``Board Selector`` or **STM32F407VG** from ``MCU/MPU Selector``.

- Select particular microcontroller from list on right side and click ``Start Project``.

You might be asked to initialize peripheral with their **default mode**. Click ``No``. But if you want to use default mode, click ``Yes``.


2. Pinout & Configuration
-------------------------

- Clear default pinouts by pressing ``Ctrl + P`` and ``Enter``. This is not recommended as some pins are already used with other peripherals on the board and might cause problems if you use them. But for now, just do as we are not using them.

- Go to ``RCC > High Speed Clock (HSE)`` and select ``Crystal Ceramic Resonator``.

- Go to ``SYS > Debug`` and select ``Serial Wire``.

  .. important::
     **ITM** uses **SWO**. If you use **ITM**, select ``Debug`` option as ``Trace Asynchronous SW`` in **STM32CubeMX** configuration.

Now you can select pins for LED, UART, Timers and many more. But leave them for now.


3. Clock Configuration
----------------------

- Specify ``HCLK (MHx)``. We prefer to use maximum clock frequency. For example, **168 MHz** if using **STM32F407VGT6** or **72 MHz** if using **STM32F103C8**.

4. Project Manager
------------------

4.1. Project
^^^^^^^^^^^^

  - Write ``Project Name``.
  
  - Write ``Project Location```.
  
  - Select ``Toolchanin/IDE``. We prefer to choose **Makefile**. **CMake** is new in **STM32CubeMX**. You can use both parallelly without any problem as generating for one tool does not remove other tool. **CubeIDE** is the best as it has many features and easy to use but it is heavy so we do not use as much.

4.2. Code Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  - Select copy all used libraries in to the project folder.
  
  - Tick:
  
    - Generate peripheral initialization as a pair '.c/.h' file per peripheral.
    - Keep user code when regenerating.
    - Delete priviously generated file when not in use.
  
  - Generate code by clicking ``GENERATE CODE``.

Navigate to project folder, open it using ``VSCODE``. If you chose ``Makefile`` as your toolchain, you would find ``Makefile``` in the project folder. If you chose ``CMake`` as your toolchain, you would find ``CMakeLists.txt`` in the project folder.

.. Tip::
   For practice, generate using both ``Makefile`` and ``CMake``.
