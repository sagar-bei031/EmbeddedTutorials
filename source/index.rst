Embedded Tutorials
==================

**Embedded System** is essential for **Robotics** and **Automation**. It is the heart of the system. **Hardware** and **Software** are the two main components of Embedded System. The hardware is the physical part of the system, and the software is the program that runs on the hardware. The software is written in Embedded C, C++, Python, etc. The working performance, efficiency and durability depends on the design of the system.


Basic Topics in the Embedded Programming that we are going to cover are:

- GPIO
- Interrupts
- Timers
- UART
- I2C
- SPI
- USB Serial


We also cover some advanced topics like:

- Actuator Control (DC Motor, Servo, BLDC, Pneumatic)
- Kinematics used for Robot
- PID
- CRC
- Filters
- IMU and other sensors
- 3D Maths
- Bluetooth
- Advance Concepts in Programming and Debugging
