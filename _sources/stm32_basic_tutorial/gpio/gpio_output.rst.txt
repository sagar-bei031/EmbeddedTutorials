1. CubeMX Configuration
------------------------

Open ``STM32CubeMx``. Generate basic code by assing osccillator pins, serial wire pins, configuring clock and project detail. Follow the `generate_basic_code <../basic_setup/generate_basic_code.html>`_ with:

- microcontroller: ``stm32f407vgt6`` or board: ``STM32F407VG-DISC1``
- project name: ``gpio_example``
- Toolchain/IDE: ``Makefile``


**STM32 Discovery** board have leds on pins ``PD12``, ``PD13``, ``PD14`` and ``PD15``. Move to ``STM32CubeMX Pinout and Congiguration``. Click ``PD12`` and select ``GPIO-Output``. For Bluepill, led pin is on ``PA13``. Generate code.

2. Understanding the Project Structure
--------------------------------------

Well, you have generated the code. Now, let's understand the project structure.

  .. image:: images/gpio_exmp_project_structure.png
     :width: 600
     :align: center
     :alt: gpio_exmp_project_structure

- ``Core``: Contains the startup main file, peripheral files and other system configuration files.
  - ``Inc``: Contains the header files.
  - ``Src``: Contains the source files.
- ``Drivers``: Contains the HAL library.
  - ``CMSIS``: Contains the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard.
  - ``STM32F4xx_HAL_Driver``: Contains the HAL library.
- ``gpio_example.ioc``: The project file. It conts configuration of the microcontroller used for *STM32CubeMX*.
- ``Makefile``: The makefile to build the project.
- ``startup_stm32f407xx.s``: The startup file. It contains the vector table and the reset handler.
- ``STM32F407VGTx_FLASH.ld``: The linker script file. It contains the memory layout of the microcontroller.

We mostly expend time on ``Core``. Since you have generated the code for GPIO, you can see ``gpio.h`` and ``gpio.c``.



3. Code to Blink LED
--------------------

Open project folder. Navigate to ``Core/Src/main.c``. You can see codes with lots of comments. These comments are special which allow separate user code and code generated by CubeMX.

.. warning::
   You must write you code inside comment block. Begin and End are specified by ``/* USER CODE BEGIN x */`` and ``/* USER CODE END x */``. Here ``x`` is the number. If you write outside this block, your code will be lost when you regenerate the code using CubeMX.

To make LED blink, move to ``while`` block of `main()`. You can use the following code:

.. code-block:: c

  /* Infinite loop */
  /* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */
  while (1)
  {
    HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOD, GPIO_PIN_12, GPIO_PIN_SET);
    HAL_Delay(1000);
    HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOD, GPIO_PIN_12, GPIO_PIN_RESET);
    HAL_Delay(1000);
    /* USER CODE END WHILE */

    /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
  }
  /* USER CODE END 3 */

Let's understand the code:

- ``HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOD, GPIO_PIN_12, GPIO_PIN_SET)``: Sets the pin ``PD12`` high.  Green led turns on.

- ``HAL_Delay(1000)``: Delays the execution for 1000ms. Green led keeps turning on for 1s.

- ``HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOD, GPIO_PIN_12, GPIO_PIN_RESET)``: Sets the pin ``PD12`` low. Green led turns off.

- ``HAL_Delay(1000)``: Delays the execution for 1000ms. Green leed keeps turning off for 1s.

Therefore, the LED will blink with 1s delay. 

You can also use ``HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOD, GPIO_PIN_12)`` to toggle the pin state.

.. note::
   
   ```Bluepill``` board have led on pin ``PC13`` which is active low. It means, on ``GPIO_PIN_SET`` led will be off and on ``GPIO_PIN_RESET`` led will be on.



4. Build and Flash
------------------

We need to add few line of code in the makefile to flash the code. Open ``Makefile`` and add the following lines at the bottom:

.. code-block:: make

   #######################################
   # flash
   #######################################
   flash: $(BUILD_DIR)/$(TARGET).bin
   	st-flash --reset write $(BUILD_DIR)/$(TARGET).bin 0x8000000

Now, build and flash the code.

.. code:: bash

   make -j
   make flash

This code only works with ``ST-Link``. If you are using ``JLink``, see `build_using_makefile <../../getting_started/basic_setup/build_using_makefile.html>`_ and `flash_using_makefile <../../getting_started/basic_setup/flash_using_makefile.html>`_.

We will continue it for `gpio input <gpio_input.html>`_.

.. function:: HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOx, GPIO_Pin, PinState)

   Sets or clears the selected data port bit.

   **Note:**
   This function uses the GPIOx_BSRR register to allow atomic read/modify accesses.
   There is no risk of an IRQ occurring between the read and modify access.

   :param GPIO_TypeDef GPIOx: GPIO peripheral where `x` can be:
      - (A..K) for STM32F429X devices
      - (A..I) for STM32F40XX and STM32F427X devices
   :param uint16_t GPIO_Pin: Specifies the port bit to be written. Can be one of the following:
      - ``GPIO_PIN_0`` through ``GPIO_PIN_15``
   :param GPIO_PinState PinState: Specifies the value to be written to the selected bit. 
      Can be one of the following:
      - ``GPIO_PIN_RESET``: Clears the port pin
      - ``GPIO_PIN_SET``: Sets the port pin

   :returns: None


.. function:: HAL_GPIO_TogglePin(GPIOx, GPIO_Pin)

   Toggles the state of the specified GPIO pins.

   :param GPIO_TypeDef* GPIOx: GPIO peripheral where `x` can be:
      - (A..K) for STM32F429X devices
      - (A..I) for STM32F40XX and STM32F427X devices.
   :param uint16_t GPIO_Pin: Specifies the pins to be toggled. This parameter can be a combination of GPIO_PIN_x values where `x` can range from 0 to 15.
   :returns: None
   :rtype: None


.. function:: HAL_Delay(Delay)

   Provides a minimum delay (in milliseconds) based on a variable that is incremented regularly.

   **Note 1:**
   In the default implementation, the SysTick timer is used as the time base. It generates interrupts at regular time intervals, where `uwTick` is incremented.

   **Note 2:**
   This function is declared as `__weak` to allow overriding by user implementations in other files.

   :param uint32_t Delay: Specifies the delay time length, in milliseconds.
   :returns: None
   :rtype: None
