1. Logic
--------

**For 3V3 microcontrollers**:

- Logic 1 above 1.88V.
- Login 0 below 1.23V.
- Most of them are 5V tolerant.

**For 5V microcontrollers:**

- Logic 1 above 3V
- Logic 0 below 1.5V


When VCC is appled to input pin, the input state will be high. And when GND is applied to input pin, the input state will be low. But if input pin is disconnected, the input is on floating state and it is hard to predict. So to remove such ambiguity pull-up or pull-down resistors are connected to input pin.

Microcontrollers have internal pull-up/pull-down resistors which can be connectd by programming. We also can connect external pull-up/pull-down resistors. Typical value for pull-up/pull-down resistors are **4.7K** and **10K**.

Pull-up resistor connects the input pin to VCC and pull-down resistor connects the input pin to GND. When input pin is not connected, pull-up resistor connects the input pin to VCC and pull-down resistor connects the input pin to GND. So, the input state will be high and low respectively.

For Open Drain output, pull-up resistor is used. For Open Collector output, pull-down resistor is used. Signals with pull-ups tend to be less sensitive to noise in noisy environments (e.g., industrial environments) because they are biased toward the high state.



2. CubeMX Configuration
-----------------------

To read the input from the GPIO pin, we need to configure the pin as input. Open ``STM32CubeMX`` to configure the pin as input. Discovery board has a user button on ``PA0`` pin. To know about this, open ``STM32F407G-DISC1`` from ``board selector`` of STM32CubeMX in default mode or see :newtab:`schematic of Discovery Board <https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.st.com/resource/en/schematic_pack/mb997-f407vgt6-b02_schematic.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjdoNq3-byIAxX5zDgGHa-OAX4QFnoECBQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0S1_y_ksxURXPd02EFhSfS>`. Select pin ``PA1`` as ``GPIO_Input``. Also select pin ``PA1`` as ``GPIO_Input``.

The pin ``PA0`` is already pulled down on the board, so we do not need to do anything with pin ``PA0`` but for pin ``PA1``, we will pull it up using internal pull-up resistor.

- From CubeMX ``Pin & Configuration``, navigate to ``System Core > GPIO``. 

- Inside ``GPIO Mode and Configuration`` under ``GPIO`` tab, select ``PA1`` from the list. ``PA1 Configuration`` will be expaned.

- From ``PA1 Configuration``, change ``GPIO Pull-up/Pull-down`` to ``Pull-up``.

- Also set pin ``PD13`` to ``GPIO_Output``.

Now generate code. 



3. Code to Check PinState
-------------------------

Open project folder. Navigate to ``Core/Src/main.c``. Update the ``while`` block.

.. code-block:: c
   :emphasize-lines: 5-27

   /* Infinite loop */
     /* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */
     while (1)
     {
       // Check pin PA0
       if (HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_0) == GPIO_PIN_SET)
       {
         // turn on green led on pin PD12.
         HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOD, GPIO_PIN_12, GPIO_PIN_SET);
       }
       else
       {
         // turn off green led on pin PD12
         HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOD, GPIO_PIN_12, GPIO_PIN_RESET);
       }
   
       // Check pin PA1
       if (HAL_GPIO_ReadPin(GPIOA, GPIO_PIN_1) == GPIO_PIN_SET)
       {
         // turn on orange led on pin PA13
         HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOD, GPIO_PIN_13, GPIO_PIN_RESET);
       }
       else
       {
         // turn off orange led on pin PA13
         HAL_GPIO_WritePin(GPIOD, GPIO_PIN_13, GPIO_PIN_SET);
       }
       /* USER CODE END WHILE */

       /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
     }
     /* USER CODE END 3 */

It is easy to understand this code.

- If pin ``PA0`` is set high i.e. user button is pressed, green led turns on else off.
- If pin ``PA1`` is set high i.e. pin ``PA1`` connected to VCC, orange led turns on else off.

Pin ``PA0`` is pulled low on the board, so not pressing user buttons connects pin ``PA0`` to GND. Pin ``PA1`` is pulled high, so not connecting anything to pin ``PA1`` sets pin ``PA1`` high.

Build and flash the code to controller.



4. Observation
--------------

You can use a jumper to connect pin ``PA1`` to connect to GND or 3V3.

- Green led turns on only if user button is pressed.
- Orange led turns off only if pin ``PA1`` is connected to GND.


Next, we will see how to use external interrupt to read the input pin.
